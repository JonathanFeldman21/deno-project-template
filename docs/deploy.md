# Deploy

Compile to a single JS file in the unversioned `build` directory.

```sh
$ make clean
$ make build
```

This file can be attached as an asset on a GitHub Release. Then it can be downloaded run.

This template app doesn't get deployed anywhere, but you can add your own steps here. Or cover how you use CI to deploy your app.
